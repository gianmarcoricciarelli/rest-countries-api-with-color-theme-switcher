# Rest Countries API with Color Theme Switcher

This is my implementation for the Frontend Mentor's challenge [Rest Countries API with Color Theme Switcher](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).
The challenge revolves around the implementation of a filterable dashboard displaying Cards with infos about the Countries take from the [Country REST API](https://restcountries.com/). Moreover, when clicking on a Card, the User must be redirected to a Detail page showing in depth infos about the selected Country.

### The Challenge's goals

- Implementing Dark Mode, that is, the UI must have a "light" theme and a "dark" theme, and the User must be able to change theme by pressing a button;
- Implementing responsiveness, that is, the UI must adapt based on the User's screen not just for Desktop and the Mobile scenario, but also for the breakpoints in between;
- Retrieve the data from a REST API, that is, the Countries' data must be retrieved from the [Country REST API](https://restcountries.com/), and all the possible scenarios (error while fetching the data, loading the data and successfully retrieving the data) must be handled;

### Implementation

In order to complete the challenge I user the following technologies:

- Typescript as main programming language;
- React as library for implementing the UI's components and logic;
- TailwindCss for handling the component's style, the Dark Mode and the responsiveness;
- Vite as bundler;
